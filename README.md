# Korea Teachers' Credit Union (Clone Project)

## 🔍 Overview
A fully responsive clone of the Korea Teachers' Credit Union website, built to practice real-world UI/UX patterns, component behavior, and frontend architecture.  
This project demonstrates my ability to reverse‑engineer complex layouts, translate design systems into code, and build accessible, responsive interfaces optimized for modern browsers.

## 🎯 Role
**UI/UX Designer & Frontend Developer**  
Owned the full design-to-development pipeline, including research, wireframing, prototyping, implementation, and QA.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** — Semantic structure and component hierarchy  
- **CSS3** — Layout, styling, responsive design, animations  
- **JavaScript / jQuery** — Interactive UI components and DOM behavior  
- **Bootstrap** — Grid system and reusable UI patterns  

---

## 🧩 Process

### 1. Research & Planning
- Analyzed the original website’s information architecture, navigation flow, and UI patterns  
- Identified key components to replicate (hero banners, tab menus, sliders, card layouts, etc.)

### 2. Wireframing & UI Design
- Created low‑fidelity wireframes to map layout structure  
- Designed high‑fidelity mockups focusing on clarity, hierarchy, and consistency  

### 3. Frontend Implementation
- Built the full layout using semantic HTML and modular CSS  
- Recreated interactive behaviors using JavaScript/jQuery  
- Applied Bootstrap for responsive grid alignment and component spacing  

### 4. Responsive Optimization
- Ensured seamless behavior across desktop, tablet, and mobile  
- Adjusted typography, spacing, and component scaling for readability  

### 5. QA & Debugging
- Conducted cross‑browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)  
- Fixed layout shifts, event handling issues, and mobile viewport bugs
