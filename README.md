ALTools UI/UX Practice Project
A front-end practice project focused on rebuilding key UI/UX patterns from the ALTools website.
The goal of this project was to study layout structure, responsive behavior, and component-based thinking by recreating selected sections of a commercial website.

🔍 Overview
This project is a hands-on exercise in translating an existing website into a clean, modular front-end structure.
While the original ALTools site is not built with React, this project explores how its UI patterns could be reinterpreted using modern front-end practices.
